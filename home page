    <p>MS Dhoni is one of the most celebrated cricketers in the history of the sport. He served as the captain of the Indian national team and is known for his exceptional leadership, calm demeanor, and finishing skills in tight matches. Under his captaincy, India won the ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.

      Dhoni is also famous for his unique wicketkeeping style and his role as a batsman who often guided his team through challenging situations. After retiring from international cricket in 2020, he continued to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the Chennai Super Kings, where he achieved significant success. His legacy in cricket is marked not just by his records but also by his sportsmanship and strategic acumen</p><hr>
